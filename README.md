# About This Project

The goal of this repository is to present a statement, and a vision, about
observability -- specifically, observability for organizations building and
operating cloud-native software. 

This project is in a _draft_ state. We are actively refining, polishing, and
iterating on the content. Our goal is to spend March 2022 doing refinement, then
make it generally available in April 2022.

## What We're Looking For

Currently, we would appreciate feedback (either via issues or pull requests) in
the following areas:

* Structure and Flow
* Comprehensability
* Undefined or Underdefined Concepts/Terms
* Underexplained/Overexplained Concepts/Terms
* General Feedback
