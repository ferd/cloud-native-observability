# The Complete Guide to Cloud-Native Observability

Over the past five years, the concept of
[observability](https://lightstep.com/observability/) has gone through a
sustained hype cycle. From being a niche concept bandied around by academicians
in discussions of control theory, to an emerging market of next-generation
software monitoring tools, to utter confusion and co-option as incumbent,
insurgent, and newly-minted companies alike scrabble to lay claim to the crown
of 'observability solution'.

A couple of years ago, we wrote a [pretty exhaustive
report](https://go.lightstep.com/rs/260-KGM-472/images/observability-guide.pdf)
about this topic -- what observability was, what distinguished it from existing
monitoring solutions, and its benefits to developers. Since then, there's been a
few important developments, and a surprising amount of new entrants, both large
and small. With that in mind, we decided to put our heads together, do some
research, and create an updated resource for the cloud-native community and
anyone else that wonders "what the heck is observability, anyway?"

Welcome, to **The Complete Guide to Cloud-Native Observability**.
