# How to Contribute

The purpose of this repository is to build, in public, an opinionated editorial
stance on the topic of cloud-native observability. To this end, we encourage
contributions from interested community members from across the cloud-native and
observability landscapes. 

This becomes a better resource with your help and time! We gladly accept Pull
Requests and Issues from everyone -- small, noncontroversial PR's (spelling,
grammar, etc.) should be accepted quickly. If you'd like to make a larger PR
that edits, removes, adds, or expands upon a section or significant portion of
the text then we'd appreciate if you opened an issue to discuss it first.
